# MicroPython-and-PySimpleGUI
Developing the path-tracking robot by using the STM32F411 development board and Raspberry Pi 4 to connect to PC.

#Prepare
1. STM32F411 development board
2. Raspberry Pi 4
3. CH340 (USB to TTL)
4. Raspberry Pi Camera
5. 5V Motor
6. Motor driver 

#Install
1. CH340 driver
2. Puttyã€€(Confirm the UART data)

#Setting
1. We need to install dfu file in STM32F411 in order to program in micropython.
2. First, switch STM32F411 to system memory boot mode.
3. Then, using DfuSe software to install STM32F411 dfu file.
4. Finally, testing some micropython example code to confirm completion

#Control
1. Building a connection between Raspberry Pi and PC.
2. Raspberry Pi will according to the camera image to make a decision about next action.
3. This decision is a series of UART commands that would send to the STM32F411 development board.
4. After receiving, the STM32F411 will generate continuous PWM signals to motor driver, then control 5V motor.
